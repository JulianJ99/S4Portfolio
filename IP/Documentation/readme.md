## User Stories

User Stories are a general explanation of a functionality written from the perspective of a user â€“ it helps put into perspective how a feature will provide value to the user.

At the start, I&#39;ve written a lot of User Stories that sounded like a good idea for a Social Media platform like my application, namely:

As user, I want to able to create an account so that I can use any functionalities that require authentication

As user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access the account I created

As user, I want to see an overview of all posts created on the homepage so that I can interact with the other users

As user, I want to create posts to communicate with other users

As user, I want to add Spotify-links to my posts so the music I want to recommend other users shows up in my posts.

As user, I want to react to posts so that I can converse with other users.

As user, I want to send friend requests so I can add other users as friends.

As user, I want to accept friend requests so I can add other users as friends.

As user, I want to be able to deny friend requests from users I&#39;d rather not have as friends.

As user, I want to be able to make my account private so only friends can see my posts.

As admin, I want to be able to delete accounts that aren&#39;t adhering to the rules.

As admin, I want to be able to delete posts that aren&#39;t adhering to the rules (by spreading hate for example, anything that isn&#39;t allowed or on topic for the current demographic)

Eventually, I decided to hone in on four user stories and fully focus on making a good basis for the application that can eventually be expanded on. 
### The user stories I decided on were:

As a user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can use functionalities that require authentication.

As user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access the account I created.

Acceptance criteria: This has to be done through Auth0. Users can make an Auth0 account or log in with their own Google account.

As user, I want to create posts to communicate with other users

As user, I want to add Spotify-links to my posts so the music I want to recommend other users shows up in my posts.

Acceptance criteria: User&#39;s name and profile image has to be added to the post to let other users know who posted that post.

## Domain Model

The domain model is the concept of the domain that makes use of both behaviour and data. It&#39;s essentially a first sketch of the classes necessary to make the project work, which in this project&#39;s case makes for a pretty meagre amount of classes, but the relationships between them is still important to pay attention to in all stages of the project.

# C4 Model

### Level 1; System Context diagram

The C1 model is a System Context diagram meant to help you step back and see the big picture, and as a result it&#39;s a great starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system. Here&#39;s where you can see how I had originally planned my project to work; by giving administrators a separate frontend where they&#39;d have all of their administrative features. I eventually had to drop RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) due to time constraints.

### Level 3; Component Diagram

The C3 Model is all about zooming in and decomposing every container further to identify the major structural building blocks and their interactions. In this case, considering the back-end uses one controller, I&#39;ve decided to zoom in on that one and see how it&#39;s functions are expected to work with the database and what it sends/receives from it.
