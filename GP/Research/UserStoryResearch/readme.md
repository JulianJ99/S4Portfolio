# Research – User stories

## Problem definition

Our current projects require user stories to get a clear image of the necessary functionalities of the application. Our knowledge in this is currently lacking, so we decided to research the topic to learn more.

# Main question: How do you write a good user story?

## Sub questions

### What is a user story?

In terms of a programming project, a user story is an example of a functionality of the project through the perspective of a potential user. Looking at the functionality through that perspective allows them to work on it in a way they originally wouldn&#39;t have thought of.

### What should be included in a user story?

A user story is a look at the application through the perspective of a user, and describes how they&#39;d expect a specific function to work. Looking at a function from this perspective makes it easier to think of what the purpose of that function is. 
To truly figure if a user story has been finished, acceptance criteria are advised; these are guidelines you can add to a user story to consider a user story complete.

### What is the Definition of Done?

The Definition of Done explains when a user story should be hypothetically finished. This can be measured through the usage of eligibility criteria:

- The code for the functionality in question has been written
- The code for the functionality in question has been thoroughly tested
- A demo of the functionality should be reviewed by the target audience
- The code should be reviewed by a fellow programmer
- The functionality should be reviewed and approved by the client

# Conclusion

A user story should give the programmers working on the project a more specific example of a feature a user would want to see – and that perspective should allow them to work on it in a way they originally wouldn&#39;t have thought of. As soon as the programming for this feature has been wrapped up, the eligibility criteria can be used to see whether or not the user story has been finished.
